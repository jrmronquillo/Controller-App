# Controller Web App
=====

Introduction
-----
Simply, this is a user interface to a python script/API that will ultimately let the user remotely send IR commands from 1-16 devices simultaneously or individually. The concepts used to develop this app were primarily an application of skills learned Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer course. 


Setup
-----
1. vagrant
2. python
3. flask





Resources
-----
Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/)


Limitations
----
1. If the python API takes unreasonably long to respond, the web app will appear stuck and does not notify the user that there is an error case.
